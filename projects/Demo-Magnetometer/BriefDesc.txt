LIS3MDL Magnetometer Demo
=========================

Calibrate Magnetometer with user intervention

Demo to run with La BLueFrog laying flat.

Note:
LIS3MDL is supposed to be calibrated in factory for zero-gauss offset.
However I see a significant offset (equivalent to soft-iron effect) -- perhaps because the factory calibration is done at 2.5V (cf datasheet) and La BLueFrog uses 3V.
So demo starts with a calibration in XY plane(Z ignored, demo assumed to be with La BLueFrog laying flat):  measure average X coordinate and average Y coordinate over 8 equally spaced orientations (angles) the theoretical is zero, the actual result is an offset to cancel.
