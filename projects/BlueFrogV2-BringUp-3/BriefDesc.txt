Clock Frequencies & USB Device Test (Mass Storage)
=================================================

Initialize board

Configure board as Mass Storage Device (8MB)
USB Device Stack runs on STM32, Physical Storage space is Data Flash

LimiFrog gets recognized by PC as USB Mass Storage drive.

LimiFrog displays current frequencies of Core Clock (HCLK) and Peripheral Clocks 1 and 2 (PCLK1 and PCLK2).


**Limitation**: if Flash is not empty and not FAT formatted, PC OS reports abnormal disk behavior.

If Flash is empty/erased, then PC proposes to format the drive (FAT16)
